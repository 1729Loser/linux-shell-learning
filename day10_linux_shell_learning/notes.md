# today i don't want do, i want quit it but 
# i remember one thing just learn at least one command. 
# i started with one command but it went very well and i learn 5-10 commands.
# starting is boring but when you push little harder like i did.
# i keep on pushing my limit by saying just one more, one more, one more, one more
# like that i learn 5-10 commands. 
# it's all about mindset. pushing little more than yesterday to become best version of myself, to become unstoppable, to become warrior who never quit.
