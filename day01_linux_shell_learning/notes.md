linux is the kernel. 
which means it acts as the intermediater between software and hardware.
like a broker.

this is not first day for me to learn about linux.
i started many times and stoped many times.
but this time not to quite it.
this is my first day. 
i wish, what i wish, i should i have to complete it.

today i learned some basic stuff,
like pwd, cd and ls commands.
absolute path and relative path.

even though i know them before but i have to start from scratch.
be patience, take time but don't lose hope that i can do it.
