# atleast learn 2 or 3 commands daily to maintain flow, rythm, movementum and consistency.

# to manage I/O streams like stdout, stdin and stderr, the system uses file descriptors.
  # the default file descriptors are :-
      0 ==> stdin
      1 ==> stdout
      2 ==> stderr

# /dev/null ==> discards everthing which is send to it.


just blindly believe that " i can do it and i have that capability. if i don't have it, then i'm going to build it " 
you can not control others but you can control you. so just work on you not others.

# THAT'S IT FOR TODAY.
